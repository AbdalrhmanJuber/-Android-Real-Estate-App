# Database Connection Fix for Favorites Functionality

## Issue Fixed
The app was crashing with "attempt to re-open an already-closed object: SQLiteDatabase" when trying to add properties to favorites.

## Root Cause
The `addToFavorites()` method was calling both `isPropertyInFavorites()` and `checkUser()` which each created their own database connections and closed them. Since SQLiteOpenHelper manages database connections as singletons, this closed the same underlying database that `addToFavorites()` was using, causing subsequent operations to fail.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created overloaded `isPropertyInFavorites()` method**: Added a version that accepts an optional `SQLiteDatabase` parameter to reuse existing connections.

2. **Created `checkUserExists()` method**: Added a new method that accepts an optional `SQLiteDatabase` parameter to reuse existing connections, avoiding conflict with existing `checkUser(email, password)` method.

3. **Updated connection management**: Both methods now check if an existing database connection is provided:
   - If provided: Reuses the existing connection without closing it
   - If not provided: Creates its own connection and closes it (backwards compatible)

4. **Modified `addToFavorites()` calls**: 
   - Updated to pass existing database connection to `isPropertyInFavorites(userEmail, propertyId, db)`
   - Updated to call `checkUserExists(userEmail, db)` instead of `checkUser(userEmail)`

## Code Changes

### DatabaseHelper.java
- Added overloaded `isPropertyInFavorites(String userEmail, int propertyId, SQLiteDatabase existingDb)` method
- Kept original `isPropertyInFavorites(String userEmail, int propertyId)` method for backwards compatibility
- Added `checkUserExists(String email, SQLiteDatabase existingDb)` method
- Kept original `checkUser(String email)` method unchanged
- Updated `addToFavorites()` to reuse database connections for both `isPropertyInFavorites()` and `checkUserExists()` calls

## Testing Status
- âœ… Build successful - no compilation errors
- ðŸ”„ Ready for user testing to verify favorites functionality works correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test the app to confirm favorites can be added successfully
2. Verify that the "Failed to add to favorites" message no longer appears
3. Test that favorites display correctly in the favorites list
